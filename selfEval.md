# Self Evaluation

- Reflect on your time management and awareness of where you spend time. Is this a strength or area you are working on? What support do you need in this area? And/or, what tips do you have to share with your classmates in this area?
    - Time management is a big thing for me, as I am prone to falling down rabbitholes or getting tunnel-vision on one thing and only one thing. I really don't know how my classmates can help me on this one, aside from bugging me every once in awhile to see if I've moved on to something else.
- How would you explain to a 5 year old what a function is? 
    -A function is like a recipe in a cookbook; a recipe provides the steps that can be used to produce an end product, or it might never be used.
- Share your understanding of arguments and parameters.
    - Parameters are variables that are part of a method definition. Meanwhile, arguments are the data that get plugged into a method's parameters.
- What questions/topics (related to Functions) do you want to being to your Small Group?
    - I have no burning questions at this time, though I look forward to the general conversation surrounding this topic. Honestly, I'm in the process of wrapping my head around everything.
